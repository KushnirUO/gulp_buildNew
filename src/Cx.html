                        create the product customers dream of. Incorporating a high level of characterization, the

                        technical constraints, our UX design process takes our clients from concept through navigation
                        to the information architecture, arriving at a document that sets out everything that will go
                        into the product.
                        <br>
                        We then produce a wireframe of the main navigation screen, complete with design look & feel,
                        presenting a functional product that we review together, making real-time updates as we go

                        With the wireframes in place, we subject the product to intensive UX review and user testing. Over the course of two days, up to ten different users in our testing lab put the mockup through its paces in a range of different scenarios.
                        <br/>
                        This is where we drill down into the user experience to ascertain whether the product is fit for purpose. We want to know: do users easily understand how to use the product? Is it actually useful? Does it answer the users’ needs? The result is an actionable document detailing what works well, what is less effective, and what needs to be fixed, all prioritized
